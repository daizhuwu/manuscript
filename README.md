This project is a creative web page that explores an excerpt from the article "Everyday Color Theory | A Crash Course on the History of Color", and also my reading response on my personal reflections experiencing the subjective nature of cross-cultural color responses. The web page is built using semantic HTML structure and styled with CSS, using the box model for layout and spacing along with creative elements like typography and color.
