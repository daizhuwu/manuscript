			<h2><strong>“Someone who speaks of the character of a colour is always thinking of just one particular way it is used.”</strong></h2>
			<p>The article “Everyday Color Theory - A poetic crash course on the history of color” touches on the personal nature of perception, highlighting perceptions of colors are highly subjective. That is, colors bring in different perceptions among individuals of diverse cultural and emotional backgrounds. I was particularly interested in the author’s viewpoint on colors helps evoking emotional responses which resonates my personal experience of intentionally choosing certain colors in branding/graphic design to create a desirable vibe for users. For example, if I were to create a color palette for an internal communication app for employees that elevates efficiency and collaboration, I would use blue as the main color to convey professionalism and intelligence. If I were to design an education app facing students/parents, I would use orange as the main color to convey warmth and friendliness, making the user experience welcoming and approachable. </p>
			<p>Color Perception is definitely a crucial part in evoking emotions but should be used cautiously according to target audience’s cultural background. Take the perception of white for example, differ significantly due to its historical and symbolic associations. White is perceived as pure, innocent in western countries. In western weddings, brides often wear white to symbolizes their purity. In Eastern countries, however, white is often associated with death since people usually wear white clothes in funerals to mourn their passings. I remember vividly when Ikea first entered China, I was shocked by the white paper lights hanging all over the cafeteria, creating a funerary atmosphere since Chinese people only use white paper lights in case of funerals. When selecting colors for decorations in a foreign countries, it is important to look at their symbolic meaning which might work counter-productively otherwise.</p>
